Applications involving unmanned aerial systems like drones, copters and glides have increased in recent times and are being applied in a wide range of fields such as infrastructure, transport, agriculture, mining, media, and transport. Human operators experience a lot of physical and mental stress and make errors while operating these aerial systems in critical and emergency scenarios such as rescue operations, mine inspection, and surveillance. Our proposed idea is to develop a mission-planning application that can autonomously guide \ac{UAV} operations even in GPS denied environments by implementing our autonomous navigational algorithm. It ultimately makes the \ac{UAV} to attain the autonomous capability and may even eliminate the human operators from the process.
